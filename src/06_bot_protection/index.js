// One gaming company found out that they are losing money because some players are using scripts that are playing for 
// players while they are sleeping.
// 
// From the access logs on their servers, developers can see which commands each player is sending. Analysing them
// they discovered that those scripts are using the same sequence of commands all the time.
// 
// Your task is to cleaned up access logs to discover bots. Cleaned up access log of one player would look like an space
// separated sequence of commands sent by the player. Detect if 3 sequential commands are repeated at least 2 times from
// the cleaned up access log.
// 
// For example we have following access log:
// 
// left right fire jump fire back forward forward jump fire back left left right
// 
// we can see that the sequence "jump fire back" is repeated two times.
